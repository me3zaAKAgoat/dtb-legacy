## Services provided:

- Good note-taking system/mind mapping system.
- Quantifiable weekly performance tracking.
- Statistics dashboard that has weeks stamped with a note about overall emotional/mental state during that period.

## Skills I want to learn through the app:

üîù [Back To Top Of Readme](https://github.com/me3zaAKAgoat/dtb#digital-tasks-board)

- Learn and master ReactJS.
- How to make a Smoothly animated website.
- How to implement a system where the state of the application is saved to the database as things change in real time.
- Write clean performant code and maintainable JS code.
- Write readable, well-documented and frequently commented code.
- Learn how to manage git repositories.
- How to make an app that uses modern web dev techniques.
- How to deploy and host a web app.
- How to use electron to turn a web app into a desktop app.
- Improve CSS skills.
- Learn basic concepts of UI and UX.

## Flow and logic of the app:

- The first note to be created sets a timer of for example 7 days (can be personalized), upon which the current tasks are archived and the week's final stats are recorded into the statistics page.
- Weeks may be terminated before the 7-day mark is reached
- When the app has been opened for the first time it should look for the current week hooked to the logged-in user then fetch all the tasks and load them to the UI.
- When a week is ended the current week id of the user is turned to Null.
- Statistics page will provide:
  - graph showing the progress through the weeks.
  - A way to access older weeks.
  - emotional/mental well-being graph pulled from stamp maker at end of week.
- When an end-the-week action is initiated>
  - the user current week key should be switched to null.
  - a modal asking for the emotinal overall satisifaction and notes about the week should show up to the user.
    - this modal can NOT be skipped by mistake and should appear WHENEVER the app is running until the user intentionally skips it.

## The database schemas:

üîù [Back To Top Of Readme](https://github.com/me3zaAKAgoat/dtb#digital-tasks-board)

- Collections: Tasks, Weeks, Users.
- Tasks belong to Weeks and Users.
- Weeks belong to Users.
- Tasks: title, description, priority, progress, and the id of weeks.
- Weeks: start date, end date, result, the id of the user, and list of task ids.
- Users: username, name, password, weeks, and current week.

## Autosave system

[IndexDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API/Using_IndexedDB)

- on frontend set a setInterval inside a useEffect that calls the function that decyphers the requests to be sent to the server.

- set a localStorage key that represents a chain of strings of this form

  - stringified object+stringified object+...

  - object to stringify

    { type : type of request, path : path to request ,object : object to send with request}

## Tasks

### Core

- [ ] set an active week id proprety on the user state
- [ ] thoroughly describe the automatic synchronization system.
- [ ] make the basic layout for the statistics page.
- [ ] make a settings page.
- [ ] make a signup page.
- [ ] rework task containers ( laggy expansion animation ).
- [x] thoroughly describe the flow/usage of the app.
- [ ] make a new proper logo.
- [ ] handle token expiration on the front-end. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61997401/how-to-logout-user-when-token-expires-in-react-app
  - log out on every JWT error response received
- [ ] read chapter 7 react router.
- [ ] add a percentage next to number input field in task container
- [x] fix modal behaviour when clicked outside of form
- [ ] add end of week button that renders a modal prompting the user to describe the week and then sends an api call to archive the ended week and create a stamp of it.
- [ ] work on custom skeleton component to every component that makes an inital fetch, so that this skeleton component only renders the wanted component after a successful fetch. (will enable moving tasks state to tasks section hopefully).
- [ ] change overall font to a more flexible one (should modern looking - minimalistic)
- [x] use the useContext hook to avoid drilling of user state.
- [ ] make function wrappers for every module that has an action that necessitates a follow up, to avoid duplication and all the issues that stem from it.
- [ ] add an indicator at the bottom of the app that tells the user how the api calls are going.
- [ ] increase responsivity of week due date state in relation to the week state
- [ ] fix the bug with editing tasks not responsively updating the current state
- [ ] fix a bug where some api calls are submitted when the task form is open without the button being clicked

### Secondary

- [x] refactor how modals work and decouple the responsibilities thrown into TasksContainer component.
- [ ] work on a loading UI (skeleton) while the data is being fetched.
- [ ] add loading animation to any component thats awaiting an api calls response (login for example).
- [x] refractor spree to make code more readable and more performant.
- [ ] make a purple theme.
- [ ] figure out how keep data stored client side (pouchDB and nedb and sessionstorage and localstorage) https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28314368/how-to-maintain-state-after-a-page-refresh-in-react-js https://rxdb.info/quickstart.html
- [ ] rich markdown text editor for notes component that behaves like discord text form parsing.
- [x] make a valorant abilities HUD inspired HUD for week status
- [x] custom context menu on tasks
  - add possibility to delete tasks
- [x] description filled on submission does not have to be non empty
- [ ] give descriptions for navbar items on long hover
- [x] make task info modals bigger
- [x] change time left to just tasks title
- [ ] add a color for thematic/visual identity
- [x] tasks should be fetched at home component level and not tasks container component and passed to TasksContainer and updated with every successful debounce api call

```js
useEffect(() => {
	ref.current = state;
}, [state]);
```

- [x] figure out how to make an animated completion circle ![Heads Up Display](/READMEcontent/HUD.png)
- [ ] learn about svgs and how to draw animations [svg circle animation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46142291/animating-react-native-svg-dash-length-of-a-circle)
- [ ] have settings open in a modal
- [x] sanitize the code for API calls on debounce
- [ ] each task should have a colored health indicator that flickers when low
- [ ] make divs flicker on validation error.
- [x] when update progress response is received tasks should be synced
- [x] fix WHY THE FUCK the user cant update two tasks progresses without fucking up the state enitrely
  - the usecallback function that enabels debouncing makes it so the memooized function always has the state of the time it was initially rendered on so any changes to state made out of it will always result in older state of other tasks.
  - so what about giving up usecallback entirely and making the file scoped and not function scoped, well then the fuckign debounces override each other and only the latest debounce will make an api call
- [x] make buttons that change in size be centered and not change height downwards but towrads all sides instead.
- [ ] replace window alerts and confirms with custom modals.
- [x] figure out how to set custom context menu to base element to something other than button.
- [ ] add a visual aspect to the priority of tasks.
- [ ] add a way the user can see the priority of a task.
- [ ] add keys in week schema that reflect the emotional/mental well-being of the user during that week.
